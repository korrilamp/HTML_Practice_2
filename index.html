	<h4>Who we are</h4>
	<div class="boxed">
	<p> Hi there! We are Somerville Sisters! We started this site after noticing the alarming
	statistics about how many young girls, women, and members of the LGBTQ+ community lack access 
	to affordable feminine hygiene products. Our goal is to connect those who have periods to the 
	materials they need to be comfortable, covered, and confident without having to worry about 
	allocating limited financial resources to this unavoidable cost.***

	<h4>What we do</h4>
	<div class="boxed">
	<p>
	Essentially, we deliver free feminine care products right to your door free of cost. We 
	recieve funding through donations, and do not ask you for any payment methods or 
	personal identifying information when you request a shipment. Our mission is to provide
	you with what you need in the most simple, anonymous way that we can work with!
